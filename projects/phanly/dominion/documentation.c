smithy - An action card from the base set that allows the player to draw 3 cards on top of their deck. The cost for this action card is 4 coins. If the player has multiple smithy cards, they are allowed to use all of them during their turn. The role of the smithy card is a terminal draw meaning that it draws the cards at the expense of an action. This also means that if a player plays the smithy card at the start of their turn then smithy is the only action card they can play for that turn.

adventurer - A terminal action card from the base set that digs for Treasure cards in the player's deck. This action card will reveal cards from the player's deck until it finds two Treasure cards. It will then put those Treasure cards in the player's hand and discard the other revealed cards. This card cost as much as Gold, 6 coins.
