The four cards I decided to break down into their own functions are listed below.

Council Room is now the function int council_roomCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
Smithy is now the function smithyCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos) 
Adventurer is now the function int adventurerCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state) 
Steward is now the function int stewardCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, int handPos) 
Salvager is now the function int salvagerCard(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state) 

*********************************************
BUGS
 Council Room:
 - Discards cards instead of draws cards
 - Missing return statement.
 
 Smithy:
 - Draws 4 cards instead of three
 
 Adventurer:
 - Doesn't discard all the cards in play 
 
 Steward:
 - No else statement for choice1 == 2
 
 Salvager:
 - Doesn't trash card properly, instead discards
