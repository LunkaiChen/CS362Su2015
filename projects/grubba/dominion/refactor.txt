Assignment 2 - Refactoring Cards
Cards refactored: Smithy, Adventurer, 
Bugs introduced: playSmithy(), Adventurer, 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cards Refactored:

Smithy
	This code implementing this card was refactored into it's own function, playSmithy().
	This function takes all necessary arguments for implementing the smithy card, that is
	arguments for currentPlayer, handPos and state. The implementation of this card didn't
	change at all in the refactor, it was just moved into a function and that function is
	called within the switch statement for playing the Smithy card.

Adventurer
	This code was moved into it's own function, playAdventurer(). The implementation of
	this card was copied into the function and the only real change was to declare the
	cardDrawn variable locally in the function and remove it's declaration from the
	cardEffect function. This function is called within the switch statement for playing
	the Adventurer card.

Village
	This code was moved into its own function, playVillage(). The implemention was
	unchanged and there was no real significant change necessary to move this card code
	into it's own function. The playVillage() function is called within the switch for
	playing the Village card.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs Introduced:

playSmithy()
	This code for the Smithy card has a subtle bug where an extra, fourth, card is drawn
	to the player's hand. This is a result of the loop not stopping when it should and 
	running a single extra time.

playAdventurer()
	The bug in the code for this card/function results in an extra treasure card being
	drawn. This is because the while loop that controls drawing treasure cards runs 
	more times than it should.

playVillage()
	The bug here is that only 1 action is given to the player from playing this card.
