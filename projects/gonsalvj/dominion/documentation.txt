/*Function: discardCard()
 *Description: Remove card from user's hand, and place in played card array or  *trash (set card to -1)
 *Params:
 *int handPos: index of card in player's hand
 *int current player: the player whose turn it is
 *gameState: state of game
 *int trashFlag: < 1 card not trashed, >=1 trash card
 */
Actual Method Flow:
If card is not trashed add card to played pile
Set the current player's card at specified index (handPos) to -1
If the index of the card (handPos) is equal to number of cards in current players hand minus 1, or if number of cards in hand is equal to one, decrement handCount of current user (number of cards in hand)
Replace discarded card with the card at the index before it
Set last card to -1 (because we have moved the last card to the discarded card's index in the hand)
decrement handCount of current user (number of cards in hand)
