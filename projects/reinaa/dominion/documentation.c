* Adventurer
  Until two treasure cards have been drawn, draw cards. Non-treasure
  cards are put into a temporary hand, while treasure cards are put in
  the player's hand. Once two treasure cards have been drawn, the
  temporary hand is discarded. If the deck is depleted and a card needs
  to be drawn, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the new draw
  pile.

* Smithy
  Three cards are drawn. The smithy card is then discarded.
