    The pieces of code that I changed where adventurer, council room, smithy, village, and great hall.  These 
pieces were placed into their own functions in dominion.c.  The individual functions are called in the original
switch statement, but the function definitions are placed in a separate area of code inside the actual functions
that were created.  

    Adventurer is now in a function called int adventurer_function that uses the arguments int currentPlayerand 
struct gameState *state.  Bugs added:  the while loop was changed so that it will loop while drawntreasure is 
less than 3 instead of 2 and they conditional statement was changed so that if a copper, silver, or gold card is
drawn the drawntreasure amount will decrement instead of increment. 

    Council room is now a function called int council_room_function that uses the arguments int handPos and 
struct gameState *state.  Bugs added:  the for loop was changed so that instead of drawing and adding 4 cards, 
the player will only get to add 3 cards.  

    Smithy is now in a function called int smithy_function that uses the arguments int handPos, int currentPlayer,
and struct gameState *state.  Bugs added:  I changed the for loop so that instead of drawing and adding 3 cards,
the player will now get to add 4 cards to the hand. 

    Village is now in a function called int village_function that uses the arguments int handPos, int currentPlayer,
and struct gameState *state.  Bugs added: instead of adding 2 actions, the adventurer card will add 4 actions.  

    Great hall is now in a function called int great_hall_function that uses the arguments int handPos, currentPlayer,
and struct gameState *state.  Bugs added: the trash flag in the discardCard function was changed from 0 to 1.
