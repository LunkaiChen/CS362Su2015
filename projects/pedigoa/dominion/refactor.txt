cards refactored: adventurer, smithy, council_room, feast, garden

For each card refactor, existing code was copied into a separate function.
Necessary parameters were added for each function (mostly game state, player number, etc).
Unnecessary variables existing in cardEffect() were commented out and equivalent local
variables added to the refactored functions.
