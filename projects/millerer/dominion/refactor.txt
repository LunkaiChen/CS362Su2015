Refactor by Eric Miller


For my changing of the code, I refactored adventurer, smithy, village, great_hall, and remode 
and made them into their own functions.

Each function is called by the original switch statement, however all code has now been moved 
to the actual funtion definitions.

Adventurer:
int adventure_card(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state);
arguments are the current player ID and state structure. These are passed into the function
from within cardEffect.

Bugs added:
I changed the condition of the original 'while' loop to break when drawntreasures is no longer 
greater than 2. In addition, I also changed the 'if' condition to increase the treasure
count to do so only when a card is copper AND silver AND gold. As such the debugger will need
to first fix the 'while' loop conditions, then go on to change the conditionals from 'AND' to 
'OR'. If they only fix the loop, then an overflow situation will occur.



Smithy:
smithy_card(int handPos,int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state);
arguments are the current hand position, player ID and state structure. These are passed 
into the function from within cardEffect.

Bugs added: Changed the trash flag in the 'discardCard' function call from 0 to 1.

Village:
int village_card(int handPos,int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state);
arguments are the current hand position, player ID and state structure. These are passed 
into the function from within cardEffect.

Bugs added: used the looping draw function from the smithy card rather than a single
draw.


Great_hall:
great_hall_card (int handPos,int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state);
arguments are the current hand position, player ID and state structure. These are passed 
into the function from within cardEffect.

Bugs added: None


Remodel:
int remodel_card (int choice1, int choice2, int handPos,int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state);
arguments are the current 2 player choices, hand position, player ID and state structure. These 
are passed into the function from within cardEffect.

Bugs added:
swapped values for parameters choice1 and choice2 inside of the function/
