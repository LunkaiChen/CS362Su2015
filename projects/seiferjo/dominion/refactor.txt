playSmithy: instead of drawing cards in a for loop from i=0 to i<3, runs from i=0 to i<=3, so it draws 4 cards instead of 3

playAdventurer: change comparison operator, checks to make sure card is not copper/silver/gold, so instead of keeping the first 2 coin cards, keeps the first 2 non-coin cards. 

playVillage: instead of drawing a card into your hand, draws a card into the previous player's card. If the current player has int value 0, action is undefined.

playCouncilroom: change the comparison operator. Instead of adding a card to every player except the current player, adds an additional card to the current player's hand

playCutpurse: No changes, should work as originally intended.
