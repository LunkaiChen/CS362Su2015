REFACTOR FILE - ASSIGNMENT 2

Changes to the dominion.c file
============
The following changes were made to the cardEffect() method:

 -The int variables drawntreasure, cardDrawn, and temphand were removed and added into the adventurerCard() method
 -The Adventurer Card switch case was condensed into a single function call to the new adventurerCard() method.
  The new method added to the file is listed below: 

	void adventurerCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer){
	    int drawntreasure = 0;
	    int cardDrawn;
	    int temphand[MAX_HAND];
	    int z = 0;
	    while(drawntreasure<2){
			if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1){//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
		  		shuffle(currentPlayer, state);
			}
			drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
			cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];//top card of hand is most recently drawn card
			if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
		  		drawntreasure++;
			else{
		  		temphand[z]=cardDrawn;
		  		state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one)
		  		z++;
			}
	    }
	    while(z-1>=0){
			state->discard[currentPlayer][state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++]=temphand[z-1]; //discard all cards in play that have been drawn
			z=z-1;
	    }
	}
  -The Smithy Card switch case was condensed into a single function call to the new smithyCard() method.
   The new method added to the file is listed below:

	void smithy(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos){
	    //+3 Cards
	    int i;
	    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)  //BUG: My smithy card is going to provide 4 cards, rather than 3
		{
		  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
		}
				
	    //discard card from hand
	    discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	}

   -The Village Card switch case was condensed into a single function call to the new villageCard() method.
    The new method added to the file is listed below:

    void villageCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos){
      //+1 Card
      drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
      
      //+2 Actions
      state->numActions = handPos + 2;  //BUG: My villageCard will will increment based on handPos instead of state->numActions
      
      //discard played card from hand
      discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	}

    -The Outpost Card switch case was condensed into a single function call to the new outpostCard() method.
    The new method added to the file is listed below:

    void outpostCard(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos){
      
      //set outpost flag
      //state->outpostPlayed++; BUG: Oops! Since this is commented, the outpostPlayed flag doesn't get set
      
      //discard card
      discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 1); BUG: This discardCard call has the trash flag set...that could be bad!)
	}

	-The Steward Card switch case was condensed into a single function call to the new stewardCard() method.
    The new method added to the file is listed below:

	void stewardCard(int choice1, int choice2, int choice3, struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos){
      if (choice1 == 1)
        {
          //+2 cards
          drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
          drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
        }
      else if (choice1 == 2)
        {
          //+2 coins
          state->coins = state->numActions + 2;  BUG: We're incrementing the coins member based on the numActions member!
        }
      else
        {
          //trash 2 cards in hand
          discardCard(choice2, currentPlayer, state, 0); BUG(s): We're trying to trash these cards, but trash flags arent set
          discardCard(choice3, currentPlayer, state, 0);
        }
      
        //discard card from hand
      discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
	
	}
